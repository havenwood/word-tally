# Monoio Best Practices Applied to word-tally

## Summary of Optimizations

After reviewing Monoio's documentation and best practices, we've optimized our implementation:

### 1. **Using `monoio::fs::read()` for Whole File Reading**
```rust
// Before: Manual file open and read_exact_at
let file = monoio::fs::File::open(path).await?;
let buffer = Vec::with_capacity(size);
let (res, buf) = file.read_exact_at(buffer, 0).await;

// After: Using optimized fs::read
monoio::fs::read(path).await
```
- Simpler and more idiomatic
- Monoio's `fs::read()` is optimized for reading entire files
- Handles buffer allocation internally

### 2. **Added Chunked Reading Support**
- Implemented `read_chunked_async()` for streaming use cases
- Uses positional `read_at()` as recommended by Monoio docs
- Explicitly closes files with `file.close().await`
- Handles errors gracefully, closing files even on failure

### 3. **Following Monoio's Ownership Model**
- Buffers are moved into async operations (ownership transfer)
- Results return both the operation result and the buffer
- This aligns with Monoio's GAT-based design for memory safety

### 4. **Best Practices Applied**
✅ Use `monoio::fs::read()` for simple whole-file reads
✅ Pre-allocate buffers when size is known
✅ Use positional reads (`read_at`, `read_exact_at`)
✅ Explicitly close files with `file.close().await`
✅ Handle the ownership model correctly (buffers moved into operations)

### 5. **Areas for Future Improvement**
1. **Runtime Reuse**: Currently creating a new runtime for each read
   - Could maintain a thread-local runtime for better performance
   - However, for word-tally's use case, the overhead is minimal

2. **Thread-per-Core Model**: Not fully utilizing Monoio's strength
   - word-tally uses Rayon for parallelism instead
   - Could potentially benefit from Monoio's thread-per-core design

3. **Network Support**: Monoio excels at network I/O
   - If word-tally adds URL support, Monoio would shine

## Performance Impact

- No regression in performance
- Cleaner, more idiomatic code
- Ready for Linux io_uring benefits
- Prepared for future async enhancements

## Conclusion

We've successfully aligned word-tally's Monoio usage with best practices while maintaining excellent performance. The implementation is now more maintainable and follows Monoio's recommended patterns.
